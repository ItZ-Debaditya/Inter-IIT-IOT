# Inter-IIT-IOT
This project was done in the 8th Inter IIT Technical meet which was held at IIT Roorkee. It is a solution to the problem statement formulated by DIC (Design Innovation center, IIT Roorkee). The problem statement was basically to build a bot to help the farmers with terrace farming.

One of the problem faced by the farmers are that they lack essential inputs such as soil moisture content, temperature, humidity etc. Terefore we have implemented IoT with the Agritech bot to curb this issue. It can used to note the real time field inputs of specific part of the land as desired by the farmer.

This repository contains only the IOT part implemented in the terrace farming bot. Soil moisture sensor, temperature and humidity sensors were used.

This project won GOLD at the Inter IIT Tech meet 8.0 among a total of 18 teams that took part for the same problem statement.
